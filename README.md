This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing a variety of statistical machine learning methods applied to regression and classification problems. The work is organized into two main parts:

Problem 1: Statistical approaches to regression (Least Squares, Bayesian inference, Expectation-Maximization, Parzen windows)

Problem 2: Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Bayes classifiers under various assumptions
